Introduction of Project
<p>This project is a modification of a traffic live map. It input traffic live data from google map, and represent it on a real map by LEDs in red or green colour. LEDs is putted in each intersection to provide traffic status. [1] If the traffic is crowded, the green LED will be turned off, and the red LED's intensity will be increased. Otherwise, red LED will be turned off and the green's intensity will be increased due to the traffic. The original project only provide 3 LEDs on the Golden Gate Bridge, and after modify my project has six LEDs and a SERVO arrow. </p>
