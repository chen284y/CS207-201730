Introduction of Project
<p>This project is a modification of a traffic live map. It input traffic live data from google map, and represent it on a real map by LEDs in red or green colour. LEDs is putted in each intersection to provide traffic status. [1] If the traffic is crowded, the green LED will be turned off, and the red LED's intensity will be increased. Otherwise, red LED will be turned off and the green's intensity will be increased due to the traffic. The original project only provide 3 LEDs on the Golden Gate Bridge, and after modify my project has six LEDs and a SERVO arrow. </p><p>

The live map will represent the two choices if the user wants to drive from U of R to Airport. The two possible way according to Google Map are :</p><p>
1. 23rd Ave - Albert St - Regina Ave. And</p><p>
2. Ring Road - Lewvan Drive.</p><p>
The second choice is 4 km longer than the first choice but it has the same amount of time costs. Additionally, the second choice only has one traffic light.</p><p>
